            Alison Johnson is finishing her first year at DePaul University
            where she is interested in business. Although she has yet to declare
            a major, sheâ€™s considering finance or marketing. After watching her
            parents run a restaurant for years, she knew at a very young age
            that she also wanted to go into business.
